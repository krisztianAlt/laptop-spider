# Laptop Spider

This is a data extraction project that I wanted to practice web crawling and scraping. The program collects data on laptops and notebooks from the Media Markt Hungary website, and displays it in the browser (https://laptop-spider.herokuapp.com/).

This is my first back-end in Node.js, and it also gave me the opportunity to practice chaining Javascript promises.
